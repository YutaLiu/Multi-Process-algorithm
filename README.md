# Multi-Process-algorithm
There are some processes which need to be executed. The running hours for each process could be represented by one positive integer number. If we have several servers, and the performance of each server is exactly the same. Please find the minimum hours that we should wait for all processes finished. Given an array of ​n(&lt;=20) ​positive integers, each integer represents the hour for each process should take. And ​m(&lt;=n) ​is the number of servers we could use. Please fill in your snippet in p2.cpp which should be compiled with c++14.
